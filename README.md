# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer:
### I have been asked to by the PyBer CEO to create a dataframe of the ride sharing data by city type using Matplotlib and Pandas. The CEO would like to see the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results of the Project:
- As expected, the total number of rides, drivers and amount of fares increases with the population leading the Urban city type to the largest amount of PyBer customers. 
- Although, the number of rides, drivers and total amount of fares increases based on how pupulated the city type is, it is more expensive to travel in less populated areas. The Rural city type has the highest average fare per ride by nearly $4.00. From this data we can make the assumption that riders should expect to pay more for their ride due to lack of supply and demand of drivers in rural areas. 
- Based on the "Total Fare by City Type" line graph, we see that Urban fares were the most consistent of the three. Urban fares started January at around $1,700 and ended around $2,300 and it peaked at nearly $2,500. While Rural fares stayed pretty consistent between $100 to $500, Suburban fares were consistely dropping with the exception of two small spikes. 

## Summary:
1) Urban cities are proving to be the most consistent and the most successful area for PyBer to continue to target. With this data we can recommend that PyBer focus on marketing in new urban areas where PyBer doesn't have a footprint in. 
2) Although Urban areas are the most successful and consistent it also proves to be very competitive for the drivers. Based on the data there was an average of 2,405 drivers and only 1,625 average rides, so PyBer either needs to put a freeze on hiring drivers or put more money into marketing efforts to give their drivers more opportunities. 
3) There are opportunities to expand in both the Suburban and Rural markets as there have been less drivers than rides. For this Pyber can primarily focus on efforts to hire more drivers to answer the demands of riders in those areas.
